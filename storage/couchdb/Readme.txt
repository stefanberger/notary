The goal of the CouchDB driver is to integrate the notary signer and
server with CouchDB as well as the cloud version of CouchDB, which is
called 'Cloudant'. The former is available as a couchdb container,
the latter through the IBM Cloud.

A good introduction for the CouchDB can be found here:

The support for the CouchDB and Cloudant requires us to accommodate
to the requirements and limitation of their configurations. Both may
be based on the same version of CouchDB, which is currently 2.1.1.
